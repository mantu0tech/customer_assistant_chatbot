🧠 What You Can Ask the Chatbot After Training

Once you train a model using this dataset, typical queries your chatbot can answer include:

📍 Support & Troubleshooting
“How do I reset my password?”
“I want to cancel my recent purchase.”
“What are my delivery options?”
“Can you check my refund status?”
“I want to update my payment info.”
These align with real-world customer concerns present in the dataset.

📍 Intent-Driven Actions

“Show me the refund policy.”
“Connect me to a human agent.”
“What’s my invoice number?
The bot can route or respond appropriately based on intent detection.

📍 Slot / Entity Usage

“Check order number 12345.” → bot recognizes and uses {{Order Number}}.
“Send an email to support@example.com
.” → bot formats or uses {{Customer Support Email}}.

📍 Natural Language Variations
The dataset includes language style variants — polite, colloquial, etc. so the bot can better understand real user phrasing (e.g., slang or typos).
